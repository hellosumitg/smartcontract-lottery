1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over(Important to note that we have a "Admin" here so this Contract would not be really decentralized as here we have a single person chooses when the lottery is over but we can sacle this out to have DAO in the admin or something like that or we could have the lottery automatically open and close based off some time parameters but for the moment this is the setup that we are going to have. Although this is much less decentralised it's still going to be a great use of smart contract technology)
3. The lottery will select a random winner

How do we want to test this ?

1. We can do `mainet-fork` here because we are only working with some on-chian contracts and some math but we will at some point of time have to do our...
2. `development` with mocks and of course with our
3. `testnet`
